Security researcher Jeremiah Folwer found a large, unsecured database of user login information from the payment company Willow Pays. Finding these types of problems is a significant part of his job, so he immediately reached out to the company and the issue was rectified shortly afterward. However, it is not clear how long this database's contents were left available to anybody to read. I am somewhat curious to see what happens to Willow Pays, as security breaches tend to have some effect or another on a company's reputation. In any case, users of Willow Pays may want to change their passwords before anything happens to their accounts.
