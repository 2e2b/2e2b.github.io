# [White house press release on "US Cyber trust mark](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/07/white-house-launches-u-s-cyber-trust-mark-providing-american-consumers-an-easy-label-to-see-if-connected-devices-are-cybersecure/)"

This article details how the US government has released a new Cyber Trust Mark, with the intended goal of quickly informing customers that a tech product is secure. In order to get this mark, a product will need to pass the cybersecurity tests adminstered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (the article did not clarify what these tests are). 

This article suggests that corporations are reacting positively to the introduction of this new approval process, which I find very intriguing given that corporations tend to dislike government oversight. Furthermore, this Cybersecurity Trust Mark could be out of reach for smaller companies, who may struggle to navigate the large amount of bureaucracy that will likely form around it. I predict this problem is likely to arise to some degree, using other goverment certifications (such as the FDA's approval process) as a frame of reference. If the government values cybersecurity as much as it should (seeing the recent cyberattacks from China), then approval standards should be rigorous enough to curtail these attacks, but that may lead to the problem I've outlined above. Either way, I'm curious to see what effect the Cyber Trust Mark produces on the US tech market.
