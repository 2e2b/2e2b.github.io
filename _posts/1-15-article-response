This article does not convince me that the malware is gone from the computers that the FBI "deleted" it from. 
From what I know about malware programs in general, they usually cannot be removed without wiping all memory cards associated with the device. The FBI's line that "the malware has a command built-in to self-delete" seems suspect, as the hackers who made the malware could have put in a fake self-delete command to put the malware in some kind of dormant state. 
If the removal command actually does what it says and deletes the malware from these systems, that is great. However, I worry that people are being tricked into thinking the problem is resolved while the Chinese hackers keep their foothold in US computer systems.
